# Programming Contest

This contest is modeled after the [ICPC programming contest](https://icpc.global/).
This is informal, it does not qualify a team for regional nor does it strictly follow contest guidelines.
The hope is for the contest to be fairly laid back and collaborative.
The point is to practice and apply computer science skills and have some fun. 
I hope that it is a good learning experience for everyone, whether it is one of your first semesters at MSU or if you have been here for too many to count :)
It is also supposed to be a fun social event (*gasp* interacting with other *human* beings?!) and there should be some yummy **pizza**. 

Please let me know if you have any questions, I am happy to help in any way that I can. 



## Contest Rules
There are teams of up to 3, who work together using one computer to solve as many problems as possible.
Scoring is done by the total number of problems solved, ties are broken by least total time. 
All code must finish within 30 seconds (time to use your big O knowledge, some input sets can be big!)

## Contest Problems
Contest Problems as well as _sample_ inputs and outputs.
**Will be posted at the start of the contest**.


## Useful Resources

Checkout the [Demo folder](./Demo/) for a full example in python and java. As well as example redirecting contents of file to standard in. 

### Sample IO
See [demo.java](./Demo/demo.java) and [demo.py](./Demo/demo.py) for examples of how to read from standard in in Java and Python.
You can expect the input to be on Standard In (std.in).
You can pipe the sample input into your python program (It is similar for Java (or any other language)) using:
```bash
python3 demo.py < sample.in
```

I personally use JetBrains products for my IDE (Intellj and Pycharm).
To do this via the IDE:
 1. Run
 2. Edit Configuration
 3. *Intellij Only*
    1. Modify options (hidden on the far right drop down)
    2. Redirect input check
 4. "Redirect Input From:" enter sample.in
 5. OK

### Sample Problems
Coming soon. 
[Check out Dr. Paxton's old contest page](https://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/contest/) for past problem sets.


## Frequently Asked Questions

1. What is the format of the contest?  

    You will be given
      several problems to solve.  Your team's goal is
      to solve as many of these problems as you can during the
      contest period.
2. What programming languages may we use?

    You can use anything that will run on the computer lab computers. If it is complicated to set up you will need to help me. I personally recommend Python 3 or Java

3. What development environments may we use?

    You may use any environment available on the lab PCs.

4. Are there any restrictions on the composition of our team?

    You may have up to 3 students on your team.  Two of
      the students must be undergraduates.  One of the 
      students can be (but doesn't have to be) a first or
      second year graduate student.

5. How many computers does our team get to use? 

    One

6. What resources do we get to use?

    You can bring
      along any number of books or notes.  The only web resource
      you can use is an online language reference manual.
      All of your programs must be written from scratch.
      Since this contest is more relaxed, you can use digital 
      class notes or textbooks if you have them. But don't
      use online resources like StackOverflow or GeeksForGeeks.

7. What happens if my team wins?

    This is informal contest, so just bragging rights and a resume item.
