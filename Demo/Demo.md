# Demo Problem

Steve Hubatiz has a child who is learning addition in elementary school.
Mr. Hubatiz is a busy person and his child has a lot of math problems to solve. 
He also is very bad at math.
He needs your help writing a program that will add numbers together so that he can help check his child's answers.

## The problem
Given two integers, your program should add them together


## The Input:
The first line contains a positive integer, n, indicating the number of problems.
The problems are on the following n lines.
Each line has two numbers, a and b, separated by a single space (' ') character.

## The Output:
On each line, output the sum of the two numbers a and b. 

## How to run?
This is really up to the user, there are a ton of ways to do this.
The goal is to pipe the contents of sample.in into the program.
This can be done with python via (similar for java if using command line):
```bash
python3 demo.py < sample.in
```

I personally use JetBrains products for my IDE (Intellj and Pycharm).
To do this via the IDE:
 1. Run
 2. Edit Configuration
 3. *Intellij Only*
    1. Modify options (hidden on the far right drop down)
    2. Redirect input check
 4. "Redirect Input From:" enter sample.in
 5. OK
